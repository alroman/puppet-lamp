Introduction
This project allows CCLE developers to automatically create a virtual image that is running the same LAMP stack that is being used for our Moodle 2.0 servers to help develop code in a production like environment.

NOTE: Please make sure you have "Virtualization Technology" or the equivalent setting enabled on your computer's BIOS.

Install VirtualBox
https://www.virtualbox.org/

Install Vagrant by following the guide at this website:
http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html

Check out vagrant/puppet scripts that will be creating CCLE's centos box
* cd ~/Projects
* git clone git://github.com/rlorenzo/puppet-lamp.git
* mv puppet-lamp moodle20

Checkout CCLE 2.0 codebase from Github
* cd  ~/Projects/moodle20
* git clone git@github.com:ucla/moodle.git (if you have ssh keys setup)
* git clone https://<github account>@github.com/ucla/moodle.git (if you want to type in your password)

Running vagrant/puppet scripts to setup CCLE's centos box
* vagrant box add vagrant-centos5.7-64-m2 https://m2dev.ccle.ucla.edu/rex/vagrant/vagrant-centos5.7-64-m2.box
* cd  ~/Projects/moodle20
* vagrant up

Pre-moodle install setup
* Create moodle database
** mysql --user=root --execute='CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;'
* Create moodle user and allow them to access moodle database (replace <PASSWORD> with something)
** mysql --user=root --execute="GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO 'moodle'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

Setup moodle
* Go to localhost:8080/moodle and follow setup wizard
* Choose /opt/moodledata for the "Data Directory"
* For database connection "Type" choose MySQLi
* Enter in the database user/password you created above.
* Next Moodle will say that it cannot create a config.php file and you will need to manually create it yourself. Please do the following:
** On the vagrant box filesystem, for your moodle script directory, create a link to the dev configuration file
*** Using the host computer
*** cd ~/Projects/moodle20/moodle
*** ln -s local/ucla/config/shared_dev_moodle-config.php config.php
** Then create a file called 'config_private.php' in the ~/Projects/moodle20/moodle directory with the database password and other details that Moodle prompted you to create for the configuration file. 
*** Be sure to remove the lines:
unset($CFG);
global $CFG;
$CFG = new stdClass();
...
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/lib/setup.php');
*** You can put other configuration data that should not go into version control in this file such as more passwords and salts.

Also, here are some post-install instructions:

Setting default theme
# Go to Site administration > Appearance > Themes > Theme selector
# Click "choose" for the  "default" row
# Find "UCLA Theme" and then click "Use theme"
# Click "Continue"

NOTES

If you want to use a database dump that includes some pre-built courses and users please do the following:
# Install
## Download the database dump file at: https://m2.ccle.ucla.edu/rex/new_moodle_instance.sql
## Dump your current moodle database and import the dump file
### If you saved the database dump file to your ~/Projects/moodle20 directory, please ssh into your VM and do the following:
#### cd /vagrant
#### mysql -u root
#### DROP DATABASE moodle;
#### CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
#### USE moodle;
#### SOURCE new_moodle_instance.sql
## Change the salt of your configuration file to be: $CFG->passwordsaltmain = 'a_very_long_salt_string';
# This database dump includes the following user accounts (login/pass):
## admin/test
## instructor/test
## student/test
# The database dump includes the following items:
## roles copied from our pilot server
## turned off most of the password requirements so that simple passwords can be used for test accounts
## Life Science and English departments for 12W
## Some Management courses for 12W

To setup a 1.9 development environment, you can do the steps above, but change the following:
* Use this image for the vagrant box
**vagrant box add vagrant-centos5.7-64 https://m2dev.ccle.ucla.edu/rex/vagrant/vagrant-centos5.7-64.box
* Edit Vagrantfile have this line instead:
** config.vm.box = "vagrant-centos5.7-64"
* Edit manifests > moodle.pp to have this line instead:
** target => "/vagrant/moodle/moodle"
* Edit files > etc > apc.ini to have this line instead:
** apc.shm_size = 48

---
If you upgrade VirtualBox your Vagrant image might not be able to mount your directory, because you need to update your VirtualBox guest additions.

* SSH into your vagrant image: vagrant ssh
* Go to http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/ and download the latest copy of VBoxGuestAdditions_X.iso for your version of VirtualBox onto /tmp
* As root:
** mount -o loop -t iso9660 /tmp/VBoxGuestAdditions_X.iso /mnt
** sh /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
